I wanted to make a proof of concent web app that integrated Python with Excel.

Essentially, how this works is that when submitting the input values in the web form, the application will take those input values, plug them into the excel sheet, and read the output of a formula in a specific row.

## TODO
 - [ ] use a production grade web server (gunicorn)?
 - [ ] Test input validation
 - [ ] Add error handling and error printing to page
 - [ ] read and output charts from excel sheet (on windows server probably)

## DISCLAIMER
This app uses the xlwings pro non commercial license.
