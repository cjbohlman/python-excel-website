I wanted to make a proof of concent web app that integrated Python with Excel.

Essentially, how this works is that when submitting the input values in the web form, the application will take those input values, plug them into the excel sheet, and read the output of a formula in a specific row.

## TODO
 - [ ] Make cells customizable for reading from/writing to and make excel file customizable (maybe an ini file?)
 - [ ] use a production grade web server (gunicorn)?
 - [ ] read charts from excel sheet

## DISCLAIMER
This app uses the xlwings pro non commercial license.
